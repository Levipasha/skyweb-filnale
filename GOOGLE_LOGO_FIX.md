# üîç Google Search Logo Fix - Complete Guide

## Problem
Your website **skywebdev.xyz** shows a generic gray circle icon in Google search results instead of your SkyWeb logo.

## Root Cause
Google Search has **specific requirements** for displaying logos:
1. Logo must be at least **112x112 pixels** (recommended: 512x512px)
2. Logo must be **square** (1:1 aspect ratio)
3. Must be specified in **structured data** (JSON-LD)
4. Logo URL must be **absolute** (not relative)
5. Must be crawlable and indexable by Google

## What I Fixed

### 1. Updated Organization Structured Data
**Before:**
```json
"logo": "https://www.skyweb.in/favicon.png"
```

**After:**
```json
"logo": {
  "@type": "ImageObject",
  "url": "https://www.skyweb.in/logo512.png",
  "width": 512,
  "height": 512
}
```

### 2. Updated Open Graph Tags
Changed from `favicon.png` to `logo512.png` with proper dimensions:
```html
<meta property="og:image" content="https://www.skyweb.in/logo512.png">
<meta property="og:image:secure_url" content="https://www.skyweb.in/logo512.png">
<meta property="og:image:type" content="image/png">
<meta property="og:image:width" content="512">
<meta property="og:image:height" content="512">
```

### 3. Updated Twitter Card
Changed to use high-resolution logo:
```html
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://www.skyweb.in/logo512.png">
<meta name="twitter:image:alt" content="SkyWeb Logo">
```

### 4. Updated Service Structured Data
Changed logo reference to use proper ImageObject:
```json
"image": {
  "@type": "ImageObject",
  "url": "https://www.skyweb.in/logo512.png",
  "width": 512,
  "height": 512
}
```

## Requirements for Google Search Logo

‚úÖ **Size:** Minimum 112x112px, recommended 512x512px (you have 512x512px ‚úì)

## Next Steps - IMPORTANT!

### Step 1: Verify Your Logo File

- **512x512 pixels** (square)
- **Your actual SkyWeb logo** (not a placeholder)
- **Clear and visible** on white background
- **Under 5MB** file size

If it's not your logo, replace it with your actual logo in 512x512px size.

### Step 2: Deploy Changes
1. Build your site: `npm run build`
2. Deploy to your hosting (Vercel/Netlify/etc.)
3. Make sure `https://www.skyweb.in/logo512.png` is accessible

### Step 3: Test Logo URL
Open in browser: `https://www.skyweb.in/logo512.png`
- Should show your SkyWeb logo
- Should be 512x512 pixels
- Should be square (not rectangular)

### Step 4: Request Google Recrawl
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Enter your URL: `https://www.skyweb.in`
3. Click "Request Indexing"
4. Wait 1-2 weeks for Google to recrawl

### Step 5: Validate Structured Data
1. Go to [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
2. Enter your URL: `https://www.skyweb.in`
3. Check if "Organization" schema is valid
4. Verify logo URL is showing correctly

## Timeline

‚è∞ **When will Google show my logo?**
