# 🎉 Database Integration Complete!

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. **Data Migration to MongoDB**
- Migrated all hardcoded team members (9 members) from `src/Team.js` to MongoDB
- Migrated all hardcoded projects (6 projects: 3 completed, 3 ongoing) from `src/Projects.js` to MongoDB
- Created migration script: `backend/scripts/migrateData.js`

### 2. **Public API Endpoints Created**
- **GET** `https://skyweb-backend.onrender.com/api/teams` - Fetch all active team members
- **GET** `https://skyweb-backend.onrender.com/api/projects` - Fetch all active projects
- **GET** `https://skyweb-backend.onrender.com/api/projects/status/:status` - Fetch projects by status (completed/ongoing)

### 3. **Updated Main Skyweb Website**
- `src/Team.js` - Now fetches team members from the database via API
- `src/Projects.js` - Now fetches projects from the database via API
- Added loading states for better UX
- Dynamic rendering of team and project cards

---

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### **Main Skyweb Site (Port 3000)**
```
Website → API Request → Backend (Port 5000) → MongoDB → Response → Display
```

1. **User visits Team page** → Fetches from `GET /api/teams`
2. **User visits Projects page** → Fetches from `GET /api/projects`
3. Data is dynamically loaded and displayed

### **Admin Panel (Port 3001)**
```
Admin → Login → Create/Edit/Delete → Backend → MongoDB → Main Site Updates Automatically
```

1. **Admin logs in** to admin panel
2. **Admin adds/edits/deletes** team members or projects
3. **Changes are saved** to MongoDB
4. **Main site automatically reflects** new data on refresh

## 🎯 How to Use the System

### **For Viewing (Public)**
1. **Start the backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Start the main site:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Visit:**
   - Main Site: http://localhost:3000
   - Team Page: http://localhost:3000/team
   - Projects Page: http://localhost:3000/projects

### **For Managing Content (Admin)**
1. **Start the backend** (if not running):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Start the admin panel:**
   ```bash
   cd admin-panel
   npm start
   ```

3. **Login to admin panel:**
   - URL: http://localhost:3001
   - Email: `admin@skyweb.com`
   - Password: `Admin@123`

4. **Manage Content:**
   - Add new team members with images
   - Edit existing team members
   - Delete team members
   - Add new projects with images
   - Edit existing projects
   - Delete projects

---

## 🔄 Adding New Data

### **Option 1: Using Admin Panel (Recommended)**
1. Login to admin panel (http://localhost:3001)
2. Navigate to Teams or Projects
3. Click "Add New Team Member" or "Add New Project"
4. Fill in the form
5. Upload image (stored in Cloudinary)
6. Click "Save"
7. **Done!** Main site will show new data immediately

### **Option 2: Re-run Migration Script**
If you want to reset all data to the original hardcoded values:
```bash
cd backend
npm run migrate:data
```

⚠️ **Warning:** This will DELETE all existing data and replace it with the hardcoded data from the migration script.

---

## 🖼️ Image Management

### **Current Image URLs**
The migrated data uses **placeholder Cloudinary URLs**. To use real images:

1. **Upload through Admin Panel:**
   - Go to Admin Panel → Edit Team Member/Project
   - Upload new image
   - Save
   - Image will be stored in Cloudinary and URL will be saved to database

2. **Manual Image Upload:**
   - Images are stored in your Cloudinary account
   - Folder structure: `skyweb/team/` and `skyweb/projects/`
